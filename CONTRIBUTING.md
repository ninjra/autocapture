## AI assistance (model preference)

- Default to the highest reasoning/thinking model available for AI-assisted changes
  and reviews.
- If your account supports a "Pro Extended" tier/mode, prefer it for non-trivial work.
- When cost/latency requires a faster model, note that choice in the PR description and
  rerun any critical reasoning steps on the highest tier when possible.
- Keep model selection local (tool settings or environment variables); do not commit
  secrets or personal overrides.
