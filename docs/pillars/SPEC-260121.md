# Pillars Declaration: SPEC-260121

## Change summary
- Add BLUEPRINT.md as a deterministic, self-contained reasoning reference.
- Add a blueprint validator and test to enforce structure and Source_Index coverage.

## Pillars impact
- Performant: no runtime impact; validation is offline and documentation-only.
- Accurate: clarifies system context and ensures coverage mapping is consistent.
- Secure: blocks external links and preserves missing-value markers.
- Citable: ties claims to Source_Index entries with enforced coverage mapping.

## Enforcement points
- tools/validate_blueprint.py
- tests/test_blueprint_validator.py

## Regression tests
- poetry run pytest -q tests/test_blueprint_validator.py
